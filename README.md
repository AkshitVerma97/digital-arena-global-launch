> **Timeline:** Fall 2024
> **Role:** Project Lead / Product Owner
> **Budget:** $10 Million (Seed & Series A)
> **Scope:** Cloud-based SaaS Platform Launch across 3 Continents (NA, EU, Asia)

## The Business Objective
**"Launch a $10M scalable live-streaming platform ('Digital Arena') that democratizes sports broadcasting for grassroots leagues globally."**

The market gap was clear: Professional tools were too expensive, and free social tools lacked sports-specific features (overlays, scoring). Our mandate was to build, test, and deploy a 4K-capable streaming engine within **9 months**, managing distributed teams across multiple time zones while navigating complex international data laws (GDPR).

---

## Execution Strategy (Hybrid Methodology)
We utilized a **Hybrid Agile-Waterfall** approach to balance software flexibility with strict infrastructure deadlines.

### 1. Waterfall for Infrastructure & Compliance
* **Regulatory Path:** Structured sequentially to handle GDPR (Europe) and COPPA (Kids' Privacy) before market entry.
* **Critical Path Analysis:** Identified **"Regulatory Approval" (70 days)** as the primary bottleneck.
    * *Mitigation:* Parallel-tracked legal consultations during the "Beta Testing" phase to prevent launch delays.

### 2. Agile for Software Development
* **Sprints:** The App and Web Platform were developed in 2-week sprints, allowing for rapid iteration of features like "Remote Scoring" and "Clip Sharing."
* **Resource Allocation:** Distributed development teams (US for UX/UI, Asia for Backend) required asynchronous communication protocols (Jira/Slack) to ensure 24-hour productivity cycles.

## Project Artifacts

### A. The Critical Path & Schedule
We decomposed the $10M scope into a **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**. The schedule highlights dependencies between the "Streaming Engine" and "App Launch."

![Project Schedule](https://github.com/AkshitVerma97/digital-arena-global-launch/blob/39d80f6746daf4cb6541d14afb6b930ed69b6d2a/assets/images/Project_Schedule.png)

*(Figure 1: High-level Gantt Chart identifying the critical path to launch)*

### B. Risk Management 
Global projects die on compliance. We created a **Risk Register** to quantify threats.
* **Top Risk:** International Regulatory Delays (High Impact).
* **Strategy:** Allocated a **15% Schedule Buffer** and engaged regional legal experts 3 months pre-launch.

*(Figure 2: Risk Matrix prioritizing threats by Likelihood and Impact)*

### C. Financial Allocation ($10M CapEx/OpEx)
* **Tech Stack ($3M):** Heavy investment in AWS/Cloud infrastructure to ensure <5ms latency.
* **Marketing ($2.5M):** Aggressive user acquisition strategy targeting grassroots leagues.

## Key Leadership Decisions
**1. The "Follow-the-Sun" Workflow**
To compress the timeline, we implemented a workflow where US teams handled Design/Strategy during their day, handing off specs to Asian development teams for overnight execution. This reduced the "Idle Time" of the project by ~30%.

**2. The Data Privacy Pivot**
Originally, the platform allowed open streaming. During the **Stakeholder Analysis**, we identified "Youth Leagues" as a key user group. I pivoted the scope to include strict **Privacy Controls** (Invite-only streams), ensuring compliance with youth protection laws (COPPA) and opening up the K-12 school market.
